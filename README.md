## How does it work?

First of all, it's needed install all the dependencies - after downloading the project, of course - as follows:


Installing all project's the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

So, get in the source (src) folder where there's application file and run:

```
npm start
```

It's running! Check it out: `http://localhost:3000/`
